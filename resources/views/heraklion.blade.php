                <p>
                    Crete is the most southern region of Greece and Europe, separating the Aegean Sea from 
                    the Libyan Sea, it marks a physical boundary between Europe and Africa.

                    with a total surface of 8,336 km², 1,100 km of coastline and approximately 623,000 inhabitants.

                    glorious Minoan civilization (c. 2700-1420 BC), are found across the island. This mix of 
                    civilizations has marked contemporary Cretan culture, which is still vibrant and 
                    distinctive as it has always been.
                </p>

                <p>

                    for its breathtaking mountain ranges, fertile valleys, the plethora of caves, gorges and 
                    plateaus of exceptional beauty as well as for its long sandy beaches and clear blue seas.

                    archaeological sites, social mores, the local proceedings, the Cretan cuisine, the natural

                <p>
                    The climate of Crete is characterized as mild and Mediterranean with four distinct seasons. 
                    It is dry and warm, which means lots of sunshine all year round, very small seasonal changes 
                    in temperatures and no extreme weather phenomena.  The average year temperature is 19°C. 
                    During May, expect the temperature to range between 20°C (at night) and 30°C, with occasional rain.

                </p>

                <p>

                <p>

                    as it hosts the University of Crete and the Foundation of Research and Technology-Hellas.

                <h3>Getting to <span class="gradient-horizon gradient-text">Heraklion</span></h3>

                <h4>By air</h4>

                <p>
                    The principal airport in Crete is Heraklion International Airport, “Nikos Kazantzakis” (airport code: HER). <b>It is the closest airport to the venue.</b>
                </p>

                <p>
                    It is located about 5 km east of the city centre of Heraklion and is directly connected to Athens International Airport (airport code: ATH) 
                    with several daily domestic flights run by Aegean Airlines, and SkyExpress Airlines. The flight duration from/to Athens is about 35min. 
                    During the summer period, there are also many direct scheduled airline connections from major European cities as well as many charter 
                    flights from most European countries.
                </p>

                <p>
                    The website of Nikos Kazantzakis International Airport is <a class="text-decoration-underline" href="www.heraklion-airport.info" target="_blank">www.heraklion-airport.info</a>.
                </p> 
                
                <h4>By boat</h4>

                <p>
                    It is also possible to arrive by boat from Piraeus (major port of Greece) to Heraklion as Minoan lines and ANEK lines provide 
                    daily ferry services from and towards Crete. In particular, at least two ferry boats sail daily to Heraklion from Piraeus. 
                    The boats sail in the evening (usually around 9-10 pm) and reach their destination early in the morning (around 5:30-6:00 am) after an 8-9 hour journey.
